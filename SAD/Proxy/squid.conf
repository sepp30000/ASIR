#       If there are no "access" lines present, the default is to deny
#       the request.
#
#       If none of the "access" lines cause a match, the default is the
#       opposite of the last line in the list.  If the last line was
#       deny, the default is allow.  Conversely, if the last line
#       is allow, the default will be deny.  For these reasons, it is a
#       good idea to have an "deny all" entry at the end of your access
#       lists to avoid potential confusion.
#
#       This clause supports both fast and slow acl types.
#       See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#
#Default:
# Deny, unless rules exist in squid.conf.
#

#
# Recommended minimum Access Permission configuration:
#
# Deny requests to certain unsafe ports
http_access deny !Safe_ports

# Deny CONNECT to other than secure SSL ports
http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports

# Only allow cachemgr access from localhost
http_access allow localhost manager
http_access deny manager

# We strongly recommend the following be uncommented to protect innocent
# web applications running on the proxy server who think the only
# one who can access services on "localhost" is a local user
http_access deny to_localhost

#
# INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE TO ALLOW ACCESS FROM YOUR CLIENTS
#
include /etc/squid/conf.d/*.conf

# Example rule allowing access from your local networks.
# Adapt localnet in the ACL section to list your (internal) IP networks
# from where browsing should be allowed
